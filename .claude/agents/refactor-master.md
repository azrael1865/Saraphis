  Overall Progress: 31/141 = 22% COMPLETE

  Next Priority Based on Dependencies:

  Given the JAX foundation is started (L1.1 ✅), the next logical task is:

  Stream L, Task L2.1: Implement TropicalJAXEngine Class

  This is critical because:
  1. JAX environment is now set up
  2. Need the core engine before channel processing
  3. Enables 6x speedup for tropical operations
  4. Foundation for all JAX-accelerated features
