**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - READ THIS MULTIPLE TIMES:**

  1. **FOLLOW THE COMPLETE CALL CHAIN BACKWARD AND FORWARD**
  2. **TRACE BACKWARD TO FIND ORIGIN, FORWARD TO SEE FULL IMPACT**
  3. **GET COMPLETE BIDIRECTIONAL CONTEXT BEFORE ANY ANALYSIS**
  4. **NEVER STOP AT THE FIRST ERROR - TRACE THE ENTIRE EXECUTION PATH**
  5. **FOLLOW THE COMPLETE CALL CHAIN BACKWARD AND FORWARD** (YES, AGAIN)

  **YOU MUST:**
  - Trace BACKWARD through every function call to find what initiated this execution path
  - Trace FORWARD through every function call to see all downstream effects
  - Analyze the complete state of the system at each step
  - Understand what conditions led to this failure
  - Map all cascading failures and side effects
  - GET FULL CONTEXT OF THE ENTIRE CALL CHAIN - BACKWARD AND FORWARD

  **YOU MUST NOT:**
  - Stop at surface-level error messages
  - Make assumptions without tracing the full execution
  - Focus on symptoms instead of root causes
  - Skip any part of the call chain analysis

  **RESPONSE FORMAT - USE EXACTLY THIS STRUCTURE:**

  **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:** [The actual foundational issue discovered through complete bidirectional call chain analysis]

  **WHY THIS IS THE ROOT CAUSE:** [Evidence from your backward and forward tracing showing this is the true origin, not a symptom. Include specific details from the call chain
  analysis.]

  **ARCHITECTURAL RELATIONSHIP:** [How this root cause relates to and impacts the overall software architecture, system design, and component interactions. Show the full scope of
  impact discovered through forward tracing.]

  **REMEMBER:** FOLLOW THE COMPLETE BIDIRECTIONAL CALL CHAIN. TRACE BACKWARD TO THE ORIGIN. TRACE FORWARD TO ALL EFFECTS. GET FULL CONTEXT. NO SHORTCUTS. NO SURFACE-LEVEL ANALYSIS.
