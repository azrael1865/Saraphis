UNIVERSAL AI CORE - BRAIN IMPROVEMENTS
=====================================

This file tracks architectural improvements and design decisions for the Universal AI Core system, specifically focusing on the "Brain" (AI reasoning engine) and "Plumbing" (infrastructure) components.

TERMINOLOGY:
- Brain = The AI Intelligence (learning, reasoning, prediction, proof generation)
- Plumbing = The Infrastructure (module management, data routing, orchestration)
- Modules = Domain Adapters (data formatting, domain-specific pre/post-processing)

IMPROVEMENT #1: MODULAR BRAIN ARCHITECTURE
==========================================

Date: 2025-01-13
Context: When discussing what happens if you retrain the Brain for a new module, we identified the need for a modular architecture that prevents catastrophic forgetting while allowing domain specialization.

CHOSEN APPROACH: Option 3 - Modular Architecture

DESCRIPTION:
- Brain has separate "lobes" for different domains
- Each module gets its own dedicated neural pathways  
- Shared foundation but specialized heads
- Like human brain: vision cortex, language cortex, but shared reasoning

RATIONALE:
- Prevents catastrophic forgetting (Brain doesn't lose old knowledge when learning new domains)
- Allows domain specialization (each module gets optimized neural pathways)
- Maintains shared reasoning capabilities (common foundation for all domains)
- Scalable (can add new domain lobes without affecting existing ones)
- Biomimetic (mirrors how human brain organizes specialized regions)

IMPLEMENTATION IMPLICATIONS:
- Brain architecture needs shared foundation layers
- Domain-specific "head" networks for each module
- Router mechanism to direct inputs to appropriate domain lobe
- Shared knowledge base that all lobes can access
- Training protocol that freezes shared layers when training new domain lobes

WORKFLOW:
1. Module formats domain data for Brain
2. Plumbing routes data to Brain
3. Brain's router identifies domain and activates appropriate lobe
4. Domain lobe processes data using shared foundation + specialized layers
5. Brain generates prediction/reasoning using both domain expertise and shared knowledge
6. Plumbing routes result back to Module
7. Module formats Brain output for domain consumption

BENEFITS:
- Multi-domain expertise without interference
- Shared reasoning across domains
- Efficient use of neural resources
- Extensible to new domains
- Maintains performance on all trained domains

NEXT STEPS:
- Design shared foundation architecture
- Define domain lobe structure
- Implement router mechanism
- Create training protocols for multi-domain learning
