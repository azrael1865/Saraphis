CHUNK BREAKDOWN FOR FINANCIAL_FRAUD_DOMAIN MODULES:
CHUNK 1: Relative Import Issues
					CHUNK 1A: Main Orchestrator
					Files: accuracy_tracking_orchestrator.py
					Issue: Relative import problems with accuracy_dataset_manager and enhanced_fraud_core_exceptions
					Focus: Fix relative import statements to absolute imports	
					CHUNK 1B: Database and Monitoring Core
					Files: accuracy_tracking_db.py, enhanced_fraud_core_monitoring.py
					Issue: Relative import problems with enhanced_fraud_core_exceptions
					Focus: Fix relative import statements to absolute imports
					CHUNK 1C: Diagnostics Module
					Files: accuracy_tracking_diagnostics.py
					Issue: Relative import problems with enhanced_fraud_core_monitoring
					Focus: Fix relative import statements to absolute imports
					This breaks the 4 files into 3 manageable chunks:
					CHUNK 1A: 1 file (212KB orchestrator)
					CHUNK 1B: 2 files (database and monitoring core)
					CHUNK 1C: 1 file (diagnostics module)
				Each chunk focuses on related modules and their import dependencies, making them easier to upload and fix individually.

					CHUNK 2: Missing Dependencies
					Files: accuracy_tracking_api.py, accuracy_tracking_config_loader.py
					Issue: Missing 'jwt' and 'toml' modules
					Focus: Install missing dependencies or provide alternatives

					CHUNK 3: Missing Classes and Definitions
					Files: enhanced_fraud_core_exceptions.py, accuracy_analytics_reporter.py
					Issue: FraudCoreError class not defined but being imported
					Focus: Add missing FraudCoreError class or fix import statements

CHUNK 4: Integration Testing
Files: All working modules + fixed modules
Issue: Test integration between modules after fixes
Focus: Ensure all modules can work together for accuracy tracking

CHUNK 5: Brain System Integration
Files: All financial_fraud_domain modules + independent_core modules
Issue: Test integration with core Brain system
Focus: Ensure accuracy tracking works with Brain training pipeline

CHUNK 6: Full Train-Test Cycle
Files: Complete system
Issue: Execute full train-test with live accuracy tracking
Focus: End-to-end testing of complete system
Each chunk builds on the previous one, fixing issues systematically before moving to integration testing.

CHUNK 4: Integration Testing - GRANULAR BREAKDOWN
CHUNK 4A: Core Module Integration Testing
Files to Upload:
financial_fraud_domain/accuracy_tracking_orchestrator.py (fixed)
financial_fraud_domain/accuracy_tracking_db.py (fixed)
test_core_integration.py (new)
Focus: Test core accuracy tracking modules can work together
Implementation:
Module import testing between orchestrator and database
Basic data flow validation
Connection establishment and basic operations
Error handling between core components
CHUNK 4B: Monitoring Integration Testing
Files to Upload:
financial_fraud_domain/enhanced_fraud_core_monitoring.py (fixed)
financial_fraud_domain/accuracy_tracking_diagnostics.py (fixed)
test_monitoring_integration.py (new)
Focus: Test monitoring components integration
Implementation:
Real-time data collection integration
Metric aggregation testing
Alert system integration
Performance monitoring integration
CHUNK 4C: Analytics and Reporting Integration
Files to Upload:
financial_fraud_domain/accuracy_analytics_reporter.py (fixed)
financial_fraud_domain/enhanced_fraud_core_exceptions.py (fixed)
test_analytics_integration.py (new)
Focus: Test analytics and reporting functionality
Implementation:
Report generation from accuracy data
Data visualization integration
Trend analysis testing
Export functionality validation
CHUNK 4D: Brain System Integration
Files to Upload:
independent_core/brain.py (enhancement)
independent_core/training_manager.py (enhancement)
test_brain_integration.py (new)
Focus: Test integration with existing Brain system
Implementation:
Training loop integration with accuracy tracking
Session management integration
Error handling integration
Performance integration
CHUNK 4E: End-to-End Workflow Testing
Files to Upload:
test_end_to_end_workflow.py (new)
All previously tested modules (reference only)
Focus: Test complete accuracy tracking workflow
Implementation:
Complete training session with accuracy tracking
Real-time monitoring during training
Report generation after completion
Performance and scalability testing
PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
Phase 1: Core Integration (Sequential)
4A â†’ 4B (Core modules first, then monitoring)
Phase 2: Parallel Integration
4C (Analytics) - Independent
4D (Brain Integration) - Independent
Phase 3: Final Integration
4E (End-to-End) - Depends on all previous chunks
DEPENDENCY MAP
Apply to brain.py
Total Chunks: 5 manageable chunks
Files per Chunk: 2-3 files maximum
Parallel Development: 2 chunks can run simultaneously
Sequential Dependencies: 3 chunks require previous completion
This is much more manageable - each chunk focuses on a specific integration area with a reasonable number of files to upload.
