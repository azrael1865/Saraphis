3. **CHUNK 4A: CPU Utilization Optimization** - Improves training performance

### **PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES:**
- Chunks 1A, 2A, and 4A can be developed simultaneously
- Each chunk has clear dependencies and deliverables
- Modular design allows independent development

### **ESTIMATED COMPLETION:**
- **Chunk 1 (Gradient Switching):** 2-3 weeks
- **Chunk 2 (Testing):** 1-2 weeks  
- **Chunk 3 (Error Recovery):** 2-3 weeks
- **Chunk 4 (Performance):** 1-2 weeks
- **Chunks 5-6 (Advanced/Production):** 3-4 weeks

**Total estimated time:** 9-14 weeks for complete system

The system has a solid foundation with most core components implemented. The main missing piece is the gradient ascent/descent switching logic, which is the key differentiator for the "learning to learn better" capability.
